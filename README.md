Game Rules:
1. You will see some fish surfacing, asking for food.
2. They stay only for a while and then... Poof! Vanish.
3. Your goal is to remember their locations and feed them peanuts.
4. Select all the cells which had fishes and click- GO!
5. Honey, you can't afford to make too many mistakes and you don't have forever!
